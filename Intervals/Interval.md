In music, an [[interval]] is a difference in frequency of two sounds.

Assuming a twelve-tone [[equal-tempered scale]], an octave is subdivided into twelve scale steps that are equally spaced on a logarithmic frequency axis. The smallest possible interval in this scale is called a [[semitone]] or a [[half step]]., which is the difference between two subsequent [[scale]] steps.

In Western music, [[interval]]s are most commonly differences between notes of a [[diatonic scale]].

When playing a note of a certain pitch on an instrument, the resulting musical tone is dominated by certain frequencies referred to as **partials**. The frequemcy of the lowest partial is called **fundamental frequency**. For harmonic sounds, the partials are (close to) integer multiples.

## Harmonic interval

A harmonic interval occurs when two notes are played at the same time.

## Melodic interval

A melodic interval occurs when two notes are played in sequence.
