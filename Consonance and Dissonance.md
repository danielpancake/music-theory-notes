In music, [[Consonance and Dissonance]] are categorizations of simultaneous or successive sounds.

Roger Kamien classifies consonance and dissonance in the following way:
```
A stable tone combination is a consonance; consonances are points of arrival, rest, and resolution.
```

```
An unstable tone combination is a dissonance; its tension demands an onward motion to a stable chord. Thus dissonant chords are "active"; traditionally they have been considered harsh and have expressed pain, grief, and conflict.
```

- [[Perfect unison]], [[perfect fifth]] and [[octave]] -- perfect consonances;
- [[perfect fourth]] -- consonant or dissonant;
- [[major second]]s and [[minor seventh]]s -- mild dissonances;
- major and minor thirds and sixths -- soft consonances;
- [[tritone]] ([[augmented fourth]] or [[diminished fifth]]) -- ambiguous, can be either neutral or restless;
- [[minor second]]s and [[major seventh]]s -- sharp dissonances;
